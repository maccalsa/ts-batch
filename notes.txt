I want to create a data scraper, leveraging "ts-batch". the site we are targeting is JS heavy so we may need a headless browser solution 

We will leverage "commander" to buikd the cli api.

we want to load data from the specific leagues from 2020 and 2025

2020 - 2021
2021 - 2022
2022 - 2023
2023 - 2024
2024 - 2025


English Permier League ecamples 
https://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/20222023/regular-season
https://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/20242025/regular-season

English league 1 example 
https://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/league-one/20242025/regular-season

<a class="vsmall" href="pmatch.asp?league=england_2024&amp;stats=1-1-2-2024"><img src="img/own/sshplogo.png" style="padding-top:3px;"></a>
English league 2 example
https://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/league-two/20242025/regular-season

each page has this html to which it uses to paginate between matches. By default he page of matches wil be the 
latest one for that season. So all previous season show you the last matches and you use previous to scroll backward
This is a js api call, which replaces the mtaches on the page.

<span class="nav_description">
  <a rel="previous" class="previous " id="page_competition_1_block_competition_matches_10_previous">« Previous</a>
  <a rel="next" class="next " id="page_competition_1_block_competition_matches_10_next">Next »</a>
</span>

We are looking for all of the matche urls, and to get them we will need to look for all of the "score-time" nodes

<td class="score-time ">
    <a href="/matches/2025/02/01/england/premier-league/nottingham-forest-fc/brighton--hove-albion-fc/4366957/">
        <span class="extra_time_score">7 - 0</span>    
    </a>
</td>

I want to create series of json files which are strings of all of the matches that were played that season
so premier-league-20212022.json for example

this is quite a challeging task to get all matches in sync with the refreshing of the match data on a button click 

we also have to make sure we 
a) don't do a ddos attack and get blocked 
b) we want to look like real user, on a real browser, so we do not look we are scraping
